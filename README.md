Galvanic Skin Response Device, a tool used for finding the conduciveness of skin due to sweat gland activity. it's main purpose is "providing insights into emotional and physiological states".

I have designed a simple circuit which can detect to sweat gland activity efficiently using voltage divider circuit.

I'll be providing step by step instructions to create the device. Hereâ€™s the final result:
